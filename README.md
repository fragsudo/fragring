> Note: Your blog must be able to add the following script in order to join the FragRing. I do not believe that Tumblr allows for outside JavaScript.

The **FragRing** is a webring. A webring is a collection/group of websites that are connected in a circular "ring"-like structure to each other. Typically, webrings are for groups of blogs that post about similar topics. In this case, this webring is dedicated to people who post about perfume or fragrances.

**If you would like to be added to the FragRing, please provide the same information as you would if you were to join the FragWeb above**. Once you are added, you will be given a unique ID number associated with you on the fragring. You need to add the following script on your site -- you can put it anywhere on the site, it does not matter. Make sure to replace **YOUR_ID_HERE** with your ID!:

```html
<script src="https://fragsudo.github.io/fragring/fragring.js"></script>
<div id="fragRingId">YOUR_ID_HERE</div>
```
