# FragRing

> Note 1: Your blog must be able to add the following script in order to join the FragRing. I do not believe that Tumblr allows for outside JavaScript.

> Note 2: There currently are not enough blogs on the FragRing to properly render the ring (which is why you see test1 and test2, which redirect to google.com and github.com -- these are placeholders!). This will be updated soon when there are more blogs added! :)
 
The **FragRing** is a webring. A webring is a collection/group of websites that are connected in a circular "ring"-like structure to each other. Typically, webrings are for groups of blogs that post about similar topics. In this case, this webring is dedicated to people who post about perfume or fragrances.

**If you would like to be added to the FragRing, please provide the same information as you would if you were to join the FragWeb above**. Once you are added, you will be given a unique ID number associated with you on the fragring. You need to add the following script on your site -- you can put it anywhere on the site, it does not matter. Make sure to replace **YOUR_ID_HERE** with your ID!:

```html
<script src="https://fragsudo.github.io/fragring/fragring.js"></script>
<div id="fragRingId">YOUR_ID_HERE</div>
```

# Badge Making?

There are a lot of online resources for making your badge if you so choose to. I recommend [this 88x31 button maker](https://hekate2.github.io/buttonmaker/) which allows you to import your own images and write your own text to arrange for your badge. Note that thsi button maker does not support exporting your creation as a GIF. If you would like to utilize some other badge as your badge, then you can visit websites like [this collection of a bunch of them](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/).
